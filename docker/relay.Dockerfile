# The enterprise relay alone (T4.10, D81): one bundled file on Node, run as a non-root user. The relay keeps nothing
# but its queue, its admissions and its revocations, all under /data; mount /data read-write and run the root
# filesystem read-only. Build from the repository root: docker build -f docker/relay.Dockerfile -t drop-relay .
